Searx
b"Searx (/s\xc9\x9c\xcb\x90rks/; stylized as searX) is a free and open-source metasearch engine,[4] available under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3, with the aim of protecting the privacy of its users.[5][6][7] To this end, Searx does not share users' IP addresses or search history with the search engines from which it gathers results. Tracking cookies served by the search engines are blocked, preventing user-profiling-based results modification.[8][9] By default, Searx queries are submitted via HTTP POST,[a] to prevent users' query keywords from appearing in webserver logs.[10][11] Searx was inspired by the Seeks project,[10] though it does not implement Seeks' peer-to-peer user-sourced results ranking.\n"
